						<p>Throughout my career I am always working on new projects whenever possible. I am most experienced with Java and Python, but I have worked on a number of different projects with different languages. Whether it's mobile development in Java or web development with PHP or Javascript with Databases, there is nothing that doesn't intrigue me. Take a look at some of the projects I have worked on below.</p>

								<h3>Reminder Pro</h3>
								<p>Reminder Pro ia an application that allows users to store their reminders on the page. Each reminder can be added or removed in real time without refreshing the browser. Users can also delete all their reminders at once if they want to get rid of all of them instead of individually removing each reminder. As the reminder approaches closer to the due date, the time for that task will be updated automatically in real time. This application was written completely with React JS.</p>
